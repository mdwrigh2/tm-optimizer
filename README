An optimizer for TinyMachine assembly with two assumptions:
  1) The 0 register always contains 0
  2) There are 8 registers (meaning the 8th register contains the current program instruction)

USAGE
./ice9 out.tm < in.tm

ice9 will read in the tiny machine instructions from stdin, and write them to the file contained in the first argument.


Optimizations Performed:
  - Constant Propagation
    This will replace all statements where the values are known with a constant load, and all conditional jumps
    with an unconditional jump or a no-op depending on whether the jump should be made or not. This doesn't actually remove instructions,
    but it is a reduction in strength and will allow dead code removal to remove a bunch of instructions rendered unnecessary by this .
  - Dead Code Removal
    This should be a global optimization. Live analysis is performed globally and then locally to determine what statements are never actually used.
    I also remove any blocks that can't be reached by looking at the "IN" of the block.
  - Jump Chaining
    I follow all jumps and remove intermediate steps that are guaranteed to happen. This doesn't necessarily remove instructions in the file,
    but it should remove instructions executed.
  - No-Op Removal
    Any no-ops such as loading the register into itself, adding 0 to itself and storing it, etc. are removed.
    The program is then recomposed with new line numbering.
  - Reduce to Halt
    This is more a special case than anything, but I thought it interesting. I reduce a program to a single HALT statement if
    the program does not contain any statements that provide visible side effect such as OUT and IN.
  - Array Reference Optimization
    I don't actually have this as its own optimization, but with constant propagation, jump chaining and dead code elimination,
    I should eliminate large chunks of the code around array references, particularly multi-dimensional arrays.
